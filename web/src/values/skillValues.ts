    title: 'Javascript',
    summary:
      'I Started to Learn Javascript after learning the basics of Python and HTML/CSS. and is where I started making small Console Projects on repl.it, then started with connecting HTML/CSS with Javascript, to make basic function website projects. Than brought React.JS into the mix creating a really good dynamic mix allowing me to create a simple more organized code base without having to manually modify the DOM. I practiced with React.JS for a few weeks getting the hang of the "this" statement and the React State, and Props, when I felt more comfortable with those types of methods, I went and included a new codebase as an addition to React and that is Redux allowing me to store variables in a Redux store that connects everywhere instead of duplicating it. with this knowledge, I spent making projects like Black Jack as a website hosted by Heroku, and many others.',

    title: 'Python 2.7 - 3.0',
    summary:
      'Python was the 3rd coding language I learned after C# and C++ and it came very natural to me and allowed me to understand more complicated methods such as loops, most of my Python coding was on repl.it which I used as a baseline to create the Black Jack Game [[https://repl.it/@Razorz/BlackJack]], I than converted that to Javascript. the other thing I built with python used selenium python to create an automated system to do a diagnostic check on some of the websites always changing modules.',

    title: 'React',
    summary:
      'Learning React came as a necessity but quickly turned into a love for building in react, with most of the projects built from React, Webpack, and Bootstrap. with some of the projects, I tend to use Material-UI to show the ability to follow a design pattern, but mostly I like creating the component from scratch, and it helps develop my skills with everything.',

    title: 'HTML & CSS',
    summary:
      'These Website languages is what I used to style and order this entire website, I use the SCSS style more than SASS but mostly just becasue its the newest version. HTML and CSS are pretty much straight forward its just align than style with CSS / SCSS, although I am still learning alot with CSS especially animations.',

    title: 'How long ive been coding...',
    summary: `My Coding Career started when I joined a Coding BootCamp called Bottega.tech in July of 2018 to October of 2018, where I graduated from the class and started working with a Company Called RoviTracker, I started working here November of 2018 till now. My Experience level, in my opinion, is at a junior to mid-level as I'm at the point where I can create a fully functional website and iterate on it and make it follow specific guidelines, this website your reading this on doesn't use too much material-UI in it as I'm trying to show my React, Redux, SCSS skills.`,
